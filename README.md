## About

>ðŸ›  Current Status: Listening to feedback, fixing issues.

This application is currently under development, it is by no means complete, fully functional, or final. There is much more to complete. However basic functionality such as viewing EFIROM info, and dumping the Fsys block is working. It has been uploaded per request, now anyone interested can get involved and ask questions.

Mac EFI Toolkit is a firmware repair tool designed to aid technicians in repair of a Mac EFIROM (BIOS). Built to be minimal, this software should achieve the following (list not final):-

```
Features:
- Original binaries left untouched, new image built from memory
- Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm for searching binary offsets
- Get information such as the PDR board-id when available
- Replace serial with automatic HWC and CRC32 calculation
- Ability to detect and decompress LZMA DXE volumes
- Clear NVRAM and EFI lock with header preservation
- Detect email address in the NVRAM (maybe)
- Detect and fix invalid Fsys checksums
- Check serial number with EveryMac
- Dump and replace Fsys block
- Mac EFI signature detection
```

```
Application:
- Automatic handling of uncaught errors
- No installation necessary
- DPI scaling support
- Memory Management
- Version checking
```

```
Requirements:
- Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10. 32, or 64-bit
- Internet connectivity for version checking (Can be disabled)
```

Incomplete source code will become available over time, then a test build should follow. This way anyone can get involved and ask questions about the work done so far.
