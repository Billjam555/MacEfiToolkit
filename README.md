## About

>ðŸ›  Current Status: Listening to feedback, fixing issues.

Mac EFI Toolkit is a firmware repair tool designed to aid technicians in repair of a Mac EFIROM (BIOS).

This application is currently under development, it is by no means complete, fully functional, or final. There is much more to complete; however functionality such as viewing ROM information, dumping the Fsys region, and repairing the Fsys crc32 is working. It has been uploaded per request, now anyone interested can get involved and ask questions.

When the editing features are implemented, original files will be left untouched. The new binary will be built from a copy in memory.

**Implemented application features:**
```
- Automatic handling of uncaught errors
- Drag and drop support for .bin files
- No installation necessary
- DPI scaling support
- Integrity checking
- Memory Management
- Version checking
```

Plus more, only time will tell.
