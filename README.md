Mac EFI Toolkit

## About

Currently under development, Mac EFI Toolkit is a GUI based software to edit and repair data in Mac EFI binaries. Designed to be minimal, this software currently achieves of the following features:-

```
- Original binaries left untouched, new image built from memory
- Get information such as the PDR board-id when available
- Replace serial with automatic HWC and CRC32 calculation
- Clear NVRAM and EFI lock with header preservation
- Detects and fixes invalid Fsys checksum
- Check serial number with EveryMac
- Dump and replace Fsys block
- Mac EFI signature detection
- DPI scaling support
- Update checking
```

Some features have been purposely left out as I'm not ready to talk about them yet, or they're just not stable. This software source code will be released under the GLP 3.0.

Updates will be added as I progress further, beta source code will be available when I feel it's ready to view; right now I think you'd cry at the mess.
