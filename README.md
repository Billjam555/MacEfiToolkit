## About

>üõ† Current Status: Listening to feedback, fixing issues.

Mac EFI Toolkit is a firmware repair tool designed to aid technicians in repair of a Mac EFIROM (BIOS).

This application is currently under development, it is by no means complete, fully functional, or final. There is much more to complete. However basic functionality such as viewing EFIROM info, and dumping the Fsys block is working. It has been uploaded per request, now anyone interested can get involved and ask questions.
