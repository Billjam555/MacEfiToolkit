</kbd>

The executable and main window of the application support drag and drop functionality for files. You can easily drag and drop files from explorer directly onto the application. However, it's important to note that this functionality will not work if the application is run as an administrator, this limitation is due to the way Windows processes drag and drop operations in elevated privileges.

</kbd>

The last write time of the loaded file.

---

#### Model:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/model.png">
</kbd>

First, the application retrieves the model identifier (e.g., IM161) from the UEFI/BIOS and then converts it into a readable format (e.g., iMac16,1). If the Hardware Configuration (HWC) is available in the Fsys store, the application appends the corresponding Configuration Code obtained from the internal database or Apple's server, resulting in a complete model name (e.g., "iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2015)").

---

#### Serial:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/serial.png">
</kbd>

This section consists of the System Serial Number (SSN) located in the Fsys store, and one button. Clicking the 'Globe' button will open a browser window to EveryMac and automatically load in the serial number. A valid serial number will consist of either 11 or 12 characters.

---

#### HWC:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/hwc.png">
</kbd>

The Hardware Configuration Code (HWC) is located in the Fsys store and is derived from the System Serial Number (SSN). If the Serial Number is 11 characters long, the HWC will be 3 characters. If the Serial Number is 12 characters long, the HWC will be 4 characters.

---

#### Fsys Store:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/fsys.png">
</kbd>
<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/fsysinvalid.png">
</kbd>

This section includes the checksum of the Fsys store and two buttons. If the CRC32 of the Fsys store is valid, the label will appear green and display the valid checksum. If the CRC32 is invalid, the label will appear red and display the invalid checksum. Clicking the "Wrench" button, which is enabled when the Fsys store checksum is invalid, will prompt a "Save As" dialog to export the binary file with a repaired Fsys CRC32 checksum. The "Save" button allows exporting of the 2048-byte (0x800h) Fsys store.

---

#### Order No:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/son.png">

</kbd>
<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/nvramlocked.png">
</kbd>

This section is divided into four items. The first three items represent different NVRAM store types, indicating their status. Each store type will appear white when empty, green when data is present, and grey when the store is not found.

The padlock item represents EFI Lock status. If the padlock icon is green and unlocked, it signifies that a Message Authentication Code (MAC) was not found, indicating that the EFI is likely not locked. Conversely, if the padlock icon is red and locked, it suggests that a Message Authentication Code (MAC) was found, indicating that the EFI is likely password locked.

---

#### Mac Board ID:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/boardid.png">
</kbd>

This section displays the 8-byte hexadecimal board-id obtained from the UEFI Platform Data Region. The Mac board-id is valuable for matching an SMC firmware or identifying a platform's logic board.

---

#### APFS Capable:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/apfsdxe.png">
</kbd>
<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/apfslzma.png">
</kbd>
<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/apfsno.png">
</kbd>

The application provides information regarding the presence of the UEFI APFS DXE driver and the firmware's capability to support APFS boot. If the driver is detected, it will display `YES (DXE)` to indicate that an uncompressed driver was found. If the driver is found within an LZMA compressed volume, it will display `YES (LZMA DXE)` to indicate that the driver was located in an LZMA compressed volume.

---

#### FIT Version:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/fit.png">
</kbd>

Displays the Flash Image Tool version found in the Intel Management Engine firmware FPT header.

---

#### Intel ME:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/intelme.png">
</kbd>

This section provides information about the Intel Management Engine (ME). It displays the ME version obtained from the MN2 manifest and indicates the base position of the ME in the UEFI. Additionally, it includes one button. Clicking the 'Save' button allows exporting the entire Management Engine firmware by extracting the portion between the 'MEBase' and 'MELimit' values defined in the Intel Flash Descriptor.

---

#### Status Bar:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/statusbar.png">
</kbd>

Located at the bottom of the main window, the status bar serves multiple purposes. It displays helpful tips when hovering over specific items (this feature can be disabled in the settings). It also shows a loading animation to indicate ongoing processes or operations. Additionally, the status bar provides information about the private memory usage for the application.

## Firmware Editor Window

This section explains the firmware editor window and its functionality.

<kbd>
  <img src="files/images/met_editor.png">
</kbd>

---

#### Fsys Store:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/fsys_replace.png">
</kbd>

When the checkbox is activated, an open file dialog will be prompted, enabling the selection and opening of the new Fsys Store. If you want to choose a different file, simply click the 'Change File' button to reopen the file dialog.

The application will verify the new Fsys Store, if CRC masking is require this will be done automatically at build time.

> ðŸ›ˆ The `Replace Serial Number` option is not available when `Replace Fsys Store` is selected.

---

#### Serial Number:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/serial_replace.png">
</kbd>

When the checkbox is activated, it will enable the 'SSN' textbox, allowing input of a new serial number. Once a valid serial number is entered, the Hardware Configuration code (HWC) will be automatically determined based on the provided serial number. It is important to note that you cannot change the HWC separately from the serial number. The HWC must match the serial number and cannot be modified independently.

The application will automatically enforce the required length of the serial number, allowing for either 11 or 12 characters. It will also provide validation to ensure that only valid characters are entered. This helps to ensure that the serial number input meets the necessary criteria and maintains the expected format.

The editor will automatically verify and mask the Fsys Store CRC32 after the serial number patching is complete.

> ðŸ›ˆ The `Replace Fsys Store` option is not available when `Replace Serial Number` is selected.

---

#### NVRAM:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/nvram_clear.png">
</kbd>

In this section, you have the option to clear specific NVRAM stores. By selecting 'Clear VSS Store', a general PRAM reset will be performed, similar to using CMD + SHIFT + P + R on the Mac keyboard. This action helps in resetting parameters stored in the VSS Store.

Alternatively, selecting 'Clear SVS Store' will remove the EFI lock in the event that a customer has forgotten their EFI password. This action effectively clears the SVS Store, which contains the Message Authentication Code (MAC) responsible for storing the EFI password.

The NSS store's specific purpose is currently unknown to me. It is included as an option for users who are knowledgeable about its functionality and potential use cases.

---

#### ME Region:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/me_replace.png">
</kbd>

When the checkbox is activated, an open file dialog will be prompted, allowing selection of a donor or clean Management Engine (ME) firmware. This feature proves useful for scenarios such as migrating a ME Region from a faulty UEFI to a donor UEFI. Additionally, it can be utilized to write a configured ME Region from a matching clean Apple firmware.

A repository of clean Apple firmware can be found here on [Github](https://github.com/gdbinit/firmware_vault). This repository provides a collection of clean Apple firmware files containing clean and configured ME regions.

It is important for the user to ensure the accurate replacement of the ME Region when utilizing the application. The application allows for the transfer of a dumped or configured region but does not provide a guarantee of accuracy.

For users who require a higher level of certainty and guidance in replacing the ME region, I recommend referring to resources such as the guide available on [Win-Raid](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/guide-clean-dumped-intel-engine-cs-me-cs-txe-regions-with-data-initialization/31277) written by platomav, or the post on [Logi.wiki](https://www.logi.wiki/index.php/Clean_EFI_ME_Region). These resources provide comprehensive instructions and information on performing a clean replacement of the ME Region while ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

#### Output:

<kbd>
  <img src="files/manual/output.png">
</kbd>

This section includes a single button and the output log. By clicking the 'Save Log' button, a save file dialog will be prompted, allowing you to export the log text to a file of your choice.

The output log serves as a valuable source of information during the validation and build process. It provides necessary details and updates to keep the user informed about the progress and status of these processes.
